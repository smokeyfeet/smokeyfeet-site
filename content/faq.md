#### When can I register?

Registration opens on the 8th of January 2016 @ 19:00 CET (UTC+1h)

#### Should I register with a partner?

You don't have to sign up with a partner, but signing up with a partner
increases your chance to leave the waiting list. We do have some spots
for single leads and follows in every level.

#### Can I register with a partner that already completed the registration process?

No, it's only possible to register as a couple if you both fill in
the name of your partner and register on the same day.

#### What happens if I end up on the waiting list?

Everyone starts out on the waiting list so your registration is initially
put on hold until we can confirm that we can offer you a spot. Once a
spot opens up you will receive an email. We hope to send out the first
confirmations within a week after registration opens.

#### Why do I have to send in a video-audition if I want to join the highest level?

We want to make sure that everyone is in the right level. To ensure this,
an audition for the highest level was the option we chose. At other events,
and in previous years at Smokey Feet, there was an audition before classes
started. For some people this is very stressful and it's time-consuming.
We want to make sure that everyone can dance as much as possible during
the weekend so doing the audition process before the event starts will
ensure this!

#### How do I pay?

When you complete the first step of registration and are off the waiting
list you’ll receive an email with a link to a questionnaire and payment
information.

#### What payment methods do you accept?

You can either pay by bank-transfer, iDEAL or Paypal.

#### Who can join the concept classes on Saturday and Sunday?

Everyone with a full pass.

#### What is the best place to stay?

Our workshop venue and party venues are in the East of Amsterdam and
Diemen. Try to find a place around this area so you won’t have to
travel far!

#### Will there be competitions?

Yes, we will have a Jack and Jill, Strictly and Solo competition. You
can sign up during your registration. If there are places left you can
also register for the competitions at the Friday party.

#### Can I volunteer?

Yes! Events like these are run by volunteers and we can use all the help
we can get! If you want to volunteer, please send an email to
[info@smokeyfeet.com](mailto:info@smokeyfeet.com) and we will hook you up!

#### Will there be tickets sold at the door?

If we don't sell out there will be a limited amount of party passes
sold at the door on Thursday and Friday. You will be able to buy single
party tickets at the door as long as we have space left.

#### What's the cancellation policy, can I sell or give away my pass to a fellow dancer?

You can find our cancellation policy in the
[Terms and Conditions](http://smokeyfeet.com/terms/).
