#### When can I register?

Registration opens in January 2016. The exact date will be announced shortly.

#### Why do I have to send in a video-audition if I want to join the highest level?

We want to make sure that everyone is in the right level. To ensure this, an
audition for the highest level was the option we chose. At other events, and in
previous years at SF, there was an audition before classes started. For some
people this is very stressful and it is time-consuming as well. We want to make
sure that everyone can dance more so doing the audition process before the
event even starts will ensure this!

#### What is the best place to stay?

Our workshop venue and main party venue is in the East of Amsterdam and Diemen.
Try to find a place around this area so you won't have to travel far!

#### Will there be competitions?

Yes, we will have a Jack and Jill, Strictly and Solo competition. You can sign
up during your registration. If there are places left you can also register for
the competitions at the Friday party.

#### Can I volunteer?

Yes! Events like these are run by volunteers and we can use all the help
we can get. If you want to volunteer, please [contact](/about/) us and we'll
hook you up!
