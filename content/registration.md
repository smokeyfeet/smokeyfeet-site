## Process

### Step 1: Sign up

Before signing up make sure you read the [Terms and Conditions](/terms/)
and [level descriptions](/workshop/levels/) to see which level suits you
best.

* A lead and follow can sign up as a couple for the workshop (full pass).

  - Both lead and follow need to sign up for the same level and on the same day
  - You can not sign up with someone who's already registered alone
  - Both of you need to mention your partner's name on the sign up form

After signing up you will receive an email confirming we've received
your signup details. **This means we received your registration
and does not mean you have secured a spot**. If this doesn't
happen contact us!

### Step 2: Wait for confirmation

Your registration is initially put on hold until we can confirm that
we can offer you a spot. Once a spot opens up you will receive an
email. In this email you'll find a link to a questionnaire and payment
information. We hope to send out the first confirmations within a week
after registration opens.

### Step 3: Complete your registration

After you have received the confirmation mail, you have 14 days to
make payment, fill in the questionnaire and send in your video audition
(if applicable). In the case we've not received payment your spot may
be given to someone else. You should receive a final email confirming
your successful registration.

<i>PIANO level: If you send in a video audition, you will get an email with
the information regarding your level placement.</i>

<i>Note: It is possible to cancel or transfer your ticket. Check the
[Terms and Conditions](/terms/) for more info.</i>
