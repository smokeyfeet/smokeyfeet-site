Choosing a level for your classes is quite difficult. It is not just
about how long you've been dancing, or how good you are at the start
of Smokey Feet. It's also about how quickly you learn new stuff, how
open you are to trying out new approaches, styles and what the level
is of fellow dancers in this workshop. Please read the level
descriptions carefully and pick the level that suits you best.

Levels are always relative to the level of the people attending the
event. If you want to join the piano level you are required to send
in a video audition. During the first class on Saturday all levels
will be reviewed by the teachers to make sure everyone is in the
right level.

## Drums

You are (quite) new to swing dancing but took classes for at least
5-6 months. Your slow steps and groove-walks are super solid, you
know the basic 6 and 8 count moves (such as the change places, the
send out and send in) and you have been introduced to the swingout
and triple steps. You've heard all about the international teachers
and are ready to be blown away by one of your very first
(international) workshops.

## Saxophone

You regularly attend social dances. Your basics are rock solid and
your package of moves is expanding. You know both 6 and 8 count
moves and use them interchangeably while social dancing. You feel
comfortable doing a swingout at 150 bpm. You have started to learn
and explore more complex elements of swing dancing, such as
connection, musicality and variations. Dancing on a medium tempo
song goes really well and relaxed.

## Bass

You're an active social dancer. You have attended quite a few
international workshops. You are confident in leading/following
which makes it possible to add styling and variations. Dancing on
faster music is still challenging for you. Next to focusing on
rhythm and technique you'll also find yourself dancing to a wider
range of tempos in these classes. You always want to challenge
yourself and are ready to take your dancing to the next level!

## Trumpet

You love social dancing. You have attended numerous international
workshops and you can find the dance floor and your dance partner
blindfolded. You know a big variety of figures and the technique
behind them. Styling your moves has become your second nature and
you are rhythmical and musical. You can easily dance to fast
music (200 bpm). You may even be part of a performance group and
you're probably competing in Jack 'n Jill and/or Strictly competitions.

## Piano

You have read all of the above levels and still think you can go
higher? Then this is the level for you. You are considered to be
one of the very best dancers in your country and have participated
in numerous international festivals in the highest level. Dancing
to very slow and very fast music (200+ bpm) doesn't make you give
up your rhythmical variations and musicality. Youâ€™re working on tiny
details to improve your dancing. You're probably teaching Lindy Hop
and have entered several international competitions. In the past
years we have had international competition winners, performers and
taster teachers participating in this level. If you want to join this
level, please be aware that you will be challenged to the max! Please
note that this level requires a video audition.
