## Ali Taghavi & Katja Uckermann

It was love at first dance: Ali & Katja have been dancing together ever
since they met on a Paris dance floor in 2003. Based in Heidelberg,
Germany, they are working to spread the Lindy hop through their
teaching teams in Heidelberg, Darmstadt and Berlin and with their
own traveling to teach workshops around Europe.

Ali & Katja are best known for their technical yet accessible teaching.
Their goal is to build upon and expand what you already know about the
dance rather than to try to change you. Their very clear step by step
"how to" instructions help you learn and practice in a focused way, so
you can transfer your new skills onto the social dance floor right away.

In their classes, you'll also get the tools how to practice and tell
yourself if you're "doing it right" outside the classroom. This way,
you can continue to improve and practice on your own and take your
dancing to the next level.

## Nicolas Deniau & Pamela Gaizutyte

Nicolas attended his first Rock'n Roll dance class at the age of 8 and after
only one year of dancing he took part in his first competition. This was the
start of a long competition career in Rock'n Roll and Boogie Woogie. He was
early drawn to the show aspect of the dance which you can still see in his
dancing!

Pamela has been dancing since she was 5 years old. She did traditional
Lithuanian folk dancing for years, until she found her passion in Lindy
hop at the age of sixteen. In 2009, she began working at Hoppers' Dance
Studio in her hometown of Vilnius, Lithuania, where she surrounds
herself with rhythm on a daily basis as she practices, performs, and
teaches Lindy hop and vernacular jazz.

Pamela Gaizutyte is one of the most exciting followers to burst onto the
international swing scene in recent years. Her creativity, personal style
and sense of musicality are an inspiration. Pamela enjoys spreading the
joy of dance and sharing her knowledge, and is excited to travel to new
and faraway places to do so.
