Let's keep it short & sweet: Iâ€™m here for all your swingin' pleasure, to make
you sweat, put that happy grin on your face and not allowing your feet a rest.
If you heard my tunes at my stompin ground in the Netherlands or elsewhere
(like Snowball, Lindy Shock, All Balboa Weekend, Berlin/Hamburg/Barcelona
Balboa Weekend, Studio Hop Summer Camp, Frim Fram Jam, Smokey Feet, Harbour
Hop)) you know I'm having all the fun in DJing for lindy hop, balboa and some
blues. My music tastes are pretty broad (try me!), but tell you what, the 1930s
were really exciting!

> I love sharing stuff... and in the dance community I found a way to share
> one of my biggest pleasures in life: Jazz music.

As one of the most active swing DJs in Lisbon (Portugal) since 2010, as an
occasional international DJ, as a swing dancer, Lindy Hop teacher and event
organizer, I know how to "read" a swing dance floor and deliver the right music
to electrify a party.  From the 20's to the present, from the chunkiness of
Swing, to the power of Big Bands, the melodic entanglement of Dixieland, the
high-energy of Jump Blues, the harmonizations of Jazz, the honey of Blues, the
shouts of Gospel, the la pompe rhythm of Manouche, it all coexists within my DJ
sets. Two things are required to glue this diversity together though: an
irresistible dancing rhythm and authenticity in playing. If the songs have
claps and/or if they talk about food, even better!

A compulsive dancer, Rohan started DJing at Lindy and Blues parties in his
local scene in Utrecht in 2012 and continued to develop his sense for what
inspires people to dance, playing regularly in festivals in the Netherlands and
abroad. His sets have evolved with his dancing, focusing increasingly on the
musicality, rhythm and feel of the music. An upbeat mixture of vintage big band
to New Orleans Jazz and everything in between, his playful sets will keep your
feet moving on the dance floor.

Seeing people smile on the floor is a great gift. This is what Stoff aims for.
A nice atmosphere with the right songs. He likes to build the tension and give
it to the crowd to play (dance) with. Whatever crowd or floor; he likes to move
it. ;)
