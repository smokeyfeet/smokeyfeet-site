Ali & Katja
-----------
It was love at first dance: Ali & Katja have been dancing together ever
since they met on a Paris dance floor in 2003. Based in Heidelberg,
Germany, they are working to spread the Lindy Hop through their
teaching teams in Heidelberg, Darmstadt and Berlin and with their
own travelling to teach workshops around Europe.

Ali & Katja are best known for their technical yet accessible teaching.
Their goal is to build upon and expand what you already know about the
dance rather than to try to change you. Their very clear step by step
"how to" instructions help you learn and practise in a focused way, so
you can transfer your new skills onto the social dance floor right away.

In their classes, you’ll also get the tools how to practice and tell
yourself if you're "doing it right" outside the classroom. This way,
you can continue to improve and practice on your own and take your
dancing to the next level.

Pamela Gaizutyte
----------------
Pamela has been dancing since she was 5 years old. She did traditional
Lithuanian folk dancing for years, until she found her passion in lindy
hop at the age of sixteen. In 2009, she began working at Hoppers' Dance
Studio in her hometown of Vilnius, Lithuania, where she surrounds
herself with rhythm on a daily basis as she practices, performs, and
teaches lindy hop and vernacular jazz.

Pamela Gaizutyte is one of the most exciting followers to burst onto the
international swing scene in recent years. Her creativity, personal style
and sense of musicality are an inspiration. Pamela enjoys spreading the
joy of dance and sharing her knowledge, and is excited to travel to new
and faraway places to do so.

Ksenia Parkhatskaya
-------------------
Graceful, eccentric, and full of character, Ksenia is one of the most
interesting and versatile artists in the jazz and swing world today.
Whether she is twisting crazy “cow tail” in Charleston, dancing to
be­bop, swinging out in Lindy Hop or singing with Jazz Bands, she
imbues everything she does with unique style and artistry.

She exploded onto the swing scene at Harlem 2011 (Vilnius), in the
solo jazz dance battle, and claiming many crowns since, but she has
been in training as a professional ballroom dancer since 1996, as an
actor, modern jazz dancer since 2005. She has a true mastery over
different genres, underpinned by a singer’s understanding of
musicality and an historian’s appreciation of authenticity. A true
artist, she isn’t afraid to embrace controversial material, and she
has been invited to perform her inimitable choreography at the most
respected tap, swing and jazz events in all over the world.

Ksenia spent several years developing an authentic aesthetic of swing
and jazz dance. This has allowed her to take her dancing to new
unexplored areas. She is presently working with modern and
contemporary jazz, fusing various styles to give solo jazz dance
a new voice.

Ksenia is performing solo with internationally recognised big bands
and trios such as: Christian McBride Trio (US), Georgyi Garanyan Big
Band (Rus), Gentlemen & Gansters (Swe), Funk/Jazz Trio (Swe), Dave
Duffy Quintet (Ireland), Soul Driven (Ireland). She creates
choreographies for TV and films such as: So You Think You Can
Dance’15 (Rus), So You Think You can Dance’15 ­ 8 (Ukr),
Ukrain’s Got Talent’13 (Ukraine), “Harbinez” TV series film (Rus).
