## Venues

### Parties

The Friday, Saturday and Sunday parties will take place in Theater de Omval.
Theater de Omval is in the heart of Diemen, about 10 minutes biking from the
class venue. The Theater has a playful atmosphere and a big hall for dancing.
The party will be spread out over two levels. The ground floor is the relaxing
area where the registration desk and cozy café are located. Upstairs is the
main ballroom with a wooden floor and amazing high ceiling! The venue is
located in the heart of Diemen and thus restaurants, supermarkets and an ATM are
within walking distance.

The venue for our Thursday and Monday will be announced as soon as possible.

### Classes

The classes on Saturday and Sunday will take place in Sportcentrum
Universum (USC). This venue has all the things you need: a café where
you can relax in between classes, showers and even a sauna. This venue
is close to the main venue where parties on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
will take place. From here to the main party venue it is only 10 minutes
by bike!

## Finding Your Way

There are over 800,000 bicycles in Amsterdam. That's more bikes than
people! Cycling in Amsterdam is a way of life, made easier by the city's
unbeatable network of bike paths, cycle routes and flat landscape. Amsterdam
regularly comes out on top in lists of the world's most cycle-friendly
cities, and there's no finer way to explore the city's streets, canals and
attractions than by pedal power. Cycling in Amsterdam is practical, enjoyable
and healthy - so join the locals and hop on your bike. Renting a bike is one
of the best ways to get around town.

Consider renting a bicycle because the two venues are within biking distance
of each other. It is a cheap and easy solution to make your way around town.
We have listed some bike-rental shops that are in the East of Amsterdam. There
is a large public transport network in Amsterdam, however, there is reduced
service at night. If you want to stay out late, renting a bike is the better
option.

Bike rental shops:

 * At [Amsterdam **Amstel** station](http://www.amstelfietspoint.nl/verhuur/)
 * Close to [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.rentabike.nl/)
 * A bit more expensive: at [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.macbike.nl/fietsverhuur/)

Planning to use public transport and want to look at the possibilities? Find
everything you need on:

 * [NS](http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/home) - Train info and schedule
 * [9292](http://9292.nl/en) - All public transport including trams, metro's, busses, trains
 * [GVB](http://en.gvb.nl/)
