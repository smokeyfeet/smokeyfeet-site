## Accommodation & Hosting

For hosting we've setup the [Smokey Feet Hosting Facebook Group]. If you
need a place to stay you can post it here and come in contact with your
future host! If you have a place for others in Amsterdam and surroundings
you can advertise it here as well and find your future guest.

## Finding Your Way

There are over 800,000 bicycles in Amsterdam. That's more bikes than
people! Cycling in Amsterdam is a way of life, made easier by the city's
unbeatable network of bike paths, cycle routes and flat landscape. Amsterdam
regularly comes out on top in lists of the world's most cycle-friendly
cities, and there's no finer way to explore the city's streets, canals and
attractions than by pedal power. Cycling in Amsterdam is practical, enjoyable
and healthy - so join the locals and hop on your bike. Renting a bike is one
of the best ways to get around town.

Consider renting a bicycle because the two venues are within biking distance
of each other. It is a cheap and easy solution to make your way around town.
We have listed some bike-rental shops that are in the East of Amsterdam. There
is a large public transport network in Amsterdam, however, there is reduced
service at night. If you want to stay out late, renting a bike is the better
option.

Bike rental shops:

 * At [Amsterdam **Amstel** station](http://www.amstelfietspoint.nl/verhuur/)
 * Close to [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.rentabike.nl/)
 * A bit more expensive: at [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.macbike.nl/fietsverhuur/)

Planning to use public transport and want to look at the possibilities? Find
everything you need on:

 * [NS](http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/home) - Train info and schedule
 * [9292](http://9292.nl/en) - All public transport including trams, metro's, busses, trains
 * [GVB](http://en.gvb.nl/)
