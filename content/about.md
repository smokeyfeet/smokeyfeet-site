## Finding Your Way

There are over 800,000 bicycles in Amsterdam. That's more bikes than
people! Cycling in Amsterdam is a way of life, made easier by the city's
unbeatable network of bike paths, cycle routes and flat landscape. Amsterdam
regularly comes out on top in lists of the world's most cycle-friendly
cities, and there's no finer way to explore the city's streets, canals and
attractions than by pedal power. Cycling in Amsterdam is practical, enjoyable
and healthy - so join the locals and hop on your bike. Renting a bike is one
of the best ways to get around town.

Since our venues are within biking distance of each other it is worth it
to rent a bike as well! It is a cheap and easy solution to make your way
around town. We have listed some bike-rental shops that are also in the
East of Amsterdam. There is a large public transport network in Amsterdam.
However, if you want to stay out late, renting a bike is the better option.

Bike rental shops:

 * At [Amsterdam **Amstel** station](http://www.amstelfietspoint.nl/verhuur/)
 * Close to [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.rentabike.nl/)
 * A bit more expensive: at [Amsterdam **Central** station](http://www.macbike.nl/fietsverhuur/)

Planning to use public transport and want to look at the possibilities? Find
everything you need on:

 * [NS](http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/home) - Train info and schedule
 * [9292](http://9292.nl/en) - All public transport including trams, metro's, busses, trains
